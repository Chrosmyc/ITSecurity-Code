                "[Microsoft Intune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Intune) is a product to manage a large \"fleet\" of devices such as laptops and smartphones. It basically allows system administrators to install updates on all company-controlled devices, but also to trigger anti-virus scans, install custom software, and so on. On a technical level, it works by installing a piece of software called Agent on the managed device. This Agent then regularly connects to the Microsoft cloud and pulls a list of commands to execute. \n",
                "\n",
                "The security of this pulling step is of utmost importance, as the resulting commands will typically be executed with full administrator privileges. Therefore, Microsoft has implemented a measure called certificate pinning, essentially hard-coding the certificate of the Microsoft cloud, to prevent person-in-the-middle attacks even when attackers somehow meddle with the local system settings. A simplified version of this certificate pinning implementation is presented below:"
