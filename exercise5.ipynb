    "\n",
    "It seems like the Grinch really hates *PresentsForEveryone*. It has moved on from interfering with the charities IT-infrastructure, and now physically attacks the logistics network. An initial attempt to just steal packets was quickly thwarted, but the Grinch improved, adapted, and overcame by switching to a more subtle approach: It now hides near the logistic centers and photographs the shipping labels of packets coming into logistic centers. Turns out that having two packets with the same shipping label can confuse a logistic center a lot. It took hours to fix wrong routings, potentially jeopardizing the presents for hunderts of kids.\n",
    "Empowered by this initial success, the Grinch starts re-printing a lot more shipping labels. Now, the whole logistic network slowly crawls to a halt. \n",
    "\n",
    "The *PresentsForEveryone* charity of course tries to detect duplicated shipping labels, but the huge number of presents (they truely target everyone) means that storing already-seen shipping label IDs is infeasible. The second attempt tries to use the sequential and strictly incrementing nature of the shipping label IDs: It simply stores the ID of the last processed shipping label, and rejects all lower shipping label IDs. However, the packets do not always arrive perfectly sequentially. The way packets are packed into shipping containers often changes the order packets are processed during unpacking. Thus, the second approach would reject a lot of perfectly legitimate packets.\n",
    "\n",
    "At some point, someone at *PresentsForEveryone* remembers that you mentioned IPSec's replay protection. They connect the dots, and notice that replay protection is pretty much the same as protecting logistic centers against duplicates, and they therefore ask you to re-implement IPSec's replay protection to prevent the Grinche's duplicated shipping labels, and to hopefully still deliver the presents in time.\n",

    "*Hint: You can directly update the sliding window in the `filter_replay` function, i.e., you need not separate replay protection and window updates. Also, think about the about potential edge cases not covered by the public tests. Make sure that your implementation remains efficient, even in potential edge cases.*"

    "The great success of your advise for the *PresentsForEveryone* nets you a nice end-of-year bonus (✨ better preparation for the exam ✨), and you can now enjoy a nice festive season with your family. But just as you picked a nice book and are fully prepared to lay back for a few days before New Year's Eve, you get a call from your boss: *\"Hey, um, listen, I hate to do this to you during the holidays, but I really need your help right now. We just got a distress call from the Toast to the Longevity of Sylvester (TLS) charity.\"*.\n",
    "\n",
    "You remember that this charity was recently presented at an internal meeting. It is developing a new super bio-degradable type of fireworks that still has all the fancy light show effects, but is much quieter to not scare dogs and other animals. They also already have developed a launching system that scans the sky for birds and times the fireworks accordingly. Turns out that this system is also really good at preventing other potentially-dangerous situation, thus significantly reducing the number of injured people. All of their developments are open-sourced, to make it as economically-viable as possible for firework manufacturers to pick up on their research and bring it to production. They do all that with the goal of having all the niceties of the Sylvester tradition while reducing the downsides as much as possible. \n",
    "\n",
    "But recently, they have been under attack by the *Patent Pending Prowler*, a nefarious patent troll. He tries to steal all the recent developments made by the charity and patenting them before they are open-sourced. And it seems like he was successful at infiltrating the charity: The sysadmins have noticed a huge traffic spike, and all kind of data is uploaded to an unknown server..\n",
